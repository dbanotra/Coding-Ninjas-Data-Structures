Given an integer array of size 2N + 1. In this given array, N numbers are present twice and one number is present only once in the array.
You need to find and return that number which is unique in the array.

int FindUnique(int arr[], int size){
    /* Don't write main().
     * Don't read input, it is passed as function argument.
     * Return output and don't print it.
     * Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
     */

int findUnique(int arr[],int n)
{
    int ans=arr[0];
    for(int i=1;i<n;i++)
    { 
        ans =ans^arr[i];
        
    }
    return ans;
    
}

i can be done by using XOR in O(N)
